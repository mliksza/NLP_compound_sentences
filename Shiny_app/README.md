In order to run this app you have a few options, the simplest one is to do the following: 

1. Copy Shiny_app directory to your local disk 
2. Install R and RStudio on your computer. Here is simple instruction: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/110/InstallingRandRStudio.pdf
3. Open one of the files in Shiny_app directory, either server.R or ui.R in RStudio. 
4. Find (at the top center of RStudio window) and click Run App button. 
5. Have fun :) 


Please, don't hesitate to provide me some feedback, this app is still under development.
